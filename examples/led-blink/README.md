LED-Blink Example
=================

A LED connect to Pin 5 (RA2/General purpose I/O) of a PIC12F1840
with 82 Ohm resistor to GND, will blink.

You can use this code as a Test, if you try to modfiy und upload the main
code. You can easy see, if something went wrong or to get in touch with the 
assambler and programming of the chip with Pick writer.

Examples:
---------

- 01: Will use classic "nop" and loops to generate blink delay.

- 02: Will use timer interrupts to generate blink delay.
