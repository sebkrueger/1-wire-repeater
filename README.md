How to modfiy
-------------

1. Write firmeware to PIC   
I used the PICKit 3 together with the lates version of free available MPLAB X IDE.
Connect PICKit 3 to USB Port, it should be autodetect in your IDE.   

*Importent Note*: You have to set the program voltage. Klick the first icon on the Dashboard 
pane to open project properties dialog. Klick on the PICkit3 entry under the Conf: default entry 
on the treeview on the left side. Choose "Power" from the "Options categories:" dropdown select. 
Mark checkbox and fill in "3.25" as Voltage Level.

Make new project, choose the right PIC (be carfull PIC 12F1840 and PIC 12LF1840 are different!!)   

Load the programm in your IDE, click on "Make and programm device in main project" toolbar icon.
